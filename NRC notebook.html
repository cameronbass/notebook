	<h1>NRC notebook</h1>
	<h2>welcome to my NRC notebook</h2>
	<p>Thsi year I have decided to put my notebook
	in the form of an HTML website. I don't know what I 
	want to do at this stage yet so the first thing to do
	is to research which projects interest me.</p>
	<p>I went to the NRC website and downloaded the 
	contest manual PDF. I opened the PDF and started 
	scrolling through. I got to the table of contents
	and found what I was looking for</p>
    <p>Robot Construction</p>
    <p>I read the rules that are on page 27 of
    the PDF linked above. What I know in this 
    phase is that I want to automate a daily function
    and use a Raspberry Pi in my project.</p>
    <p>will update the code before it even goes live
    under the bold Update headers.</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>here is a list of all the things that 
    happen to a typical student on a daily basis.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>wake up (alarm clock)</li>
    <li>shower</li>
    <li>brush teeth</li>
    <li>breakfast</li>
    <li>dinner</li>
    </ol>
    <p>note that their are many more things that can be automated with
    code. I will achieve these in other projects that you can find</p>
    <p>here.</p>
    <p>For now we will continue to only focus on things that could be 
    automated with a robot.</p>
    <p>This is the end of this update. See ya ;)</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>Today I will explain how each one of the list items in the last 
    section can be turned into some sort of robotic project. </p>
    <ol>
    <li>waking up</li>
    <p>Alot of people use alarm clocks to wake up. They don't actually
    have anything to do with robot construction. So I will no longer
    be using it in the list.</p>
    <li>shower</li>
    <p>this can be automated with robotics. However, I found myself
    asking if it really needed to be. No. So, it will also leave the list</p>
    <li>breakfast</li>
    <p>This can and has been done before. If I were to do this I would 
    use one of my favorite recipes that I got from a friend on a sleepover.
    German pancakes. They are fairly simple. However if I were to use a 
    robot to automate the cooking process I would have to tweak the cooking
    method. The recipe requires heating an oven to 450 degrees after melting
    butter on a burner. Another problem is that the recipe takes 20 minutes
    to bake. I think this one is going to be my project.</p>
    <li>bruch teeth</li>
    <p>I acually had this before breakfast on the list and Just saw it.
    It may be a better choice actually. The time limit is ten minutes
    for the robots action. If I created some sort of bathroom sink mounted
    device that picked up the toothbrush and could give a decent tooth 
    brushing for people in the morning and had a phone app that reminds you
    to brush on your own in the evening to really ensure a good brush. 
    This seems like an easier and just as cool project. It is also more 
    useful. </p>
    <li>dinner</li>
    <p>It soundss somewhat original based on what I have seen in the 
    last NRC and what I have heard about ones before that. Everyone 
    makes breakfast foods. What if a robot could make a quick dinner
    dish.</p>
    </ol>
    <p>Before I end this update ther is one Idea that I have had. What
    if I coded the pure software stuff or started it during the 
    interactivity challenge. I of course would not get very far into the
    code, It would be a great starting point just so I cna get advice. Or
    I could make a preview of the GUI in scratch after making the images
    prior to the event.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>thats it for now!</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>I was given another idea for a breakfast bot by my little 
    brother. This would be a robot that could mae toast. what if it made
	made french toast. :0s</p>
	<h1>Update</h1>
	<p>Believe it or not, I think my little brother's idea would actually be
	pretty cool. I have decided to start thsi as my project.</p>
	<p>So, in order to figure out what actions the robot must take
	we must find what is needed to make french toasdt. Below are the steps 
	needed for a human.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>crack some eggs into a bowl and whisk them</li>
	<li>dip a slice of bread into the eggs and throw it onto a grittle</li>
	<li>when the egg on the bread is cooked, serve on a plate.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For a robot it must complete the smae actions, but unlike
	humans it needs more descriptions. The list items are rather vague.
	Also, in order for the robot to be applicable for the NRC Robot 
	Construction event, the robot must make one peice every ten minutes.
	In order to achieve this a set of instruction that are more detailed
	must be set into place. This will help me to know which parts I will
	need in my desighn.</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Once activated, eggs will have been cracked into a bowl by the
	operator and a stack of bread will be present in a certain spot.</li>
	<li>the robot msut take a piece of bread from the pile and put it 
	into the bowl of whisked eggs. (If I have time I might add an 
	automatic whicker as well. </li>
	<li>butter a grittle</li>
	<li>move the bread around in order to get some egg soaked into it</li>
	<li>Take this piece of bread out of the machine and place it onto
	a griddle</li>
	<li>wait a few minutes and flip the toast and wait a few more minutes
	before taking the toast off of the griddle and
	place it onto a plate</li>
	</ol>
    <p>The only step that would need to be clarified from here is how
    long to keep the bread on the griddle. I wouldn't want to be serving
    raw eggs.</p>
    <p>To find the amount of time it takes I am going to conduct an 
    experiment next weekend to see how long it takes to cook french toast.
    This will decide whether the project will meet the ten minute 
    requirement and how long the robot must wait to flip and serve the toast.</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>I have decided to just estimate the time for now because I can't
    wait until next weekend. with the list I created last tim, I can now 
    </p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>It is time to make a parts list and start some plans for biulding.</p>
    <p>I want some software that will let me make a 3D model first. However,
    my computer has a pentium two in it so I don't know how that will go.</p>
    <p>I decided to install Blender to make a 3D model before I actually 
    go out and find parts to biuld my robot. I also am going to draw out
    an idea of what I want it to be on paper.</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    /*add images of rough sketches*/fjn
    <p>I have made some rough sketches on what I want the robot to be and I have 
    a pretty good idea of what I want it to be. I want to start with a 
    slab of wood as the base. holes will be cut out for a griddle, mixing bowl,
    and a dedicated place to keep the bread. I also forgot to add a place 
    where the toast will be served.</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>I opened up Blender and remembered that you need a mouse that isn't
    a trackpad. Time to order a mouse.</p>
	<h1>update</h1>
    <p>It has been awhile since i have made an entry to this notebook. Alot has happened in the relm of the blender project. 
	I borrowed my grandma's mouse to do alot of the blender work and then finished up on my desktop in my room at my dad's house.
	I created everything besides the arms in a 3d model on Blender.</p>
	<!--add image of 3D render here-->
	<p>Whle I was gone I also got Isaac on board with the idea. I went to his house and we used his computer to work on the 3D render.
	Now that the 3D render is done it is ready to be constructed in the real world.</p>
    </body>
	<h1>update</h1>
	<p>This morning dad was helping me look for a piece of wood that would be suitible for the base. We decided to scale everything
	down to 4 feet by feet. That way it would be a more managable size. I also showed him the 3D render that I made with Isaac and he 
	now has a better underswtanding of what I want to biuld and he seems to be more on board with the idea.</p>
	<h1>Update</h1>
	<p>We made quite alot of progress on the slab of wood today. We decided to go for two feet wide and four feet long. That
	would basically be only the top half of my render, which is ok because that is where everything is and it will cut down on the
	total cost. this Sunday we are going to get our cut down piece fo wood ready to be biult on. It needs to be sanded down and cuated
	so that it is a surface that can be kept steril.</p>
	<h1>Update</h1>
	<p>Today I sanded down the wood and put a coating of primer on the wood. I learned about different grains of sandpaper and how to
	coat it with primer. During the process I also thought about how many people could be put out of work if this were automated. 
	I am pretty sure that thhis has already been done though. Imagine how many jobs there would be if everyones door was made by hand.</p>
	<h1>Update</h1>
	<p>My dad thought that I wanted tjo paint the piece of wood which I owuld have done, but I prefered a stain instead. Dad found
	some stain and after I got off of my computer, he showed me how to stain the wood. I just finished putting the first coat on and I 
	am going to do the second in a few hours</p>
	<!--add pictures of wood before stain and after dirst coat of stain as well as a link to the update video-->
	<h1>update</h1>
	<p>the second coat has been applied. Here are some pictures.</p>
	<!--add pictures of wood aftet the second coat of stain-->
	<h1>Update</h1>
    <p>Today I made some progress on the slab of wood for the first time in awhile. I buffed the second coat of stain and added polyurethane This will give the wood a glossy look when it Cries tomorrow morning.</p>
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>Isaac and I looked online for somehting we could use for the frame. The funniest thing is I never thought of just googleing metal wiht holes in it. 
    we found some stuff on home depot's website. We also found another piece of metal on home depot for the top of the machine.
    I think instead of just putting cross bars accross hwere I want the arms to be I could just find a piece of metal that is as big
    as the wood is. I am thinking of cutting the wooden base in two again so that we have a 2x2x2 foot cube.</p>
    <p>here are the links for the things Isaac and I looked at.</p>	
    <!--add link to home depot for the frame and top piece as well as a link to that indean website-->
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>Today grandpa took me to the Geek Group national science center. I am drooling over a memebership. This place has so many
    resources that I could use. I talked to my dad and mom whom both said that they couldn't afford it. However, my grandma said that she could get me a 
    membership</p>
    <!--add link to the website of the geek center as well as scans of the panthlet and pictures of the place from the tour on saturday-->
    <h1>Update</h1>
    <p>The top of the frame is complete. My dad wants to make the supports
    out of wood. I will probably make some out of metal at the Geek group tomorrow.
    Here are some pictures of me making the frame that my dad took.</p>
    <!--add pictures dad sent of me cutting the metal-->
